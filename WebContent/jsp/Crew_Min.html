Anyone who is attending for the first time and is not familiar with all the many activities planned for the crew and their families is invited to contact me at cowtownjan@bellsouth.net. We are excitedly anticipating the attendance of several current crewmembers serving onboard the CG63 stationed in Japan. Our community extends wide opened arms and hearts to you all and hopes to have the chance to meet more of the outstanding, courageous, heroic men and women who have served onboard the two finest ships in the United States Navy. Be prepared to be spoiled rotten and leave our hometown knowing that you've found ties with family and friends which will last a lifetime.
