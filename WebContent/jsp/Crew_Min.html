    <p>
    Our ship is home... our ship is home!  The USS Cowpens CG63 is back stateside now residing 
    in San Diego after 10+ years of superior service in Japan.  The threat of decommissioning is no 
    longer a worry for the near future... thank you very much!
</p> 
<p>
To all crew members and family members with service on our ships during WWII or in the past 24 years on the CG63 – we encourage you to make time to come join us in Cowpens for the 36th Annual Mighty Moo Festival & Reunion.  I can "guar-an-tee" you've never experienced 
 anything like it.
</p>
<p>
Any questions from crew or family members can be directed to the Mighty Moo Reunion 
Veteran’s Point of Contact – Jan Humphries, at 864-542-6489 or at cowtownjan@bellsouth.net.

Anyone who is attending for the first time and is not familiar with all the many activities planned for the crew and their families is invited to contact me at cowtownjan@bellsouth.net. We are excitedly anticipating the attendance of several current crewmembers serving onboard the CG63 stationed in Japan. Our community extends wide opened arms and hearts to you all and hopes to have the chance to meet more of the outstanding, courageous, heroic men and women who have served onboard the two finest ships in the United States Navy. Be prepared to be spoiled rotten and leave our hometown knowing that you've found ties with family and friends which will last a lifetime.

There's nothing left for you to do but come on and join the festivities.  We'll be watching for you!
