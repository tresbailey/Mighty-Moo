<p>
Hello from Jan Humphries! I am the designated point of contact for our veterans and their family members who attend our yearly event. It continues to be our great joy, pleasure, and utmost honor to invite USS Cowpens CVL25 and CG63 crewmembers and their families to join us in Cowpens, SC, for the 34th Annual Mighty Moo Reunion & Festival. For those who have been with us in the past, we're so glad you are coming back! For those who have never had the chance to come experience the Moo, we're waiting on you! 
</p> 
<span class="title-text">Hotel Accommodations</span>
<p>
The USS Cowpens Reunion Association has been headquartered at the same location for the past several years.  It was formally known as the Radisson Hotel & Suites, but is now a Clarion Hotel located at 9027 Fairforest Rd., Spartanburg, SC 29301 (located on Exit 2C on Business I-85). Their phone number is 864-574-2111 or 1-800-333-3333.  Be sure to let them know you are with the Cowpens Moo Reunion when reservations are made. The room rate is $65.00/night for either 2 Queen beds or 1 King bed. These are nice rooms with a coffee pot, hair dryer, and an ironing board.  An added benefit is the elevator, so no one will have to climb stairs.     
</p>
<span class="title-text">Weekend Activities</span>
<p>
The Cowpens Mighty Moo Festival includes many enjoyable events. Most events are held at our beautiful Veterans Park. Next to it is the Historic Depot where the USS Cowpens Museum is housed; it will be open Friday and Saturday during the event for visitors to enjoy. Carnival rides will be running for families to enjoy three nights. Crewmembers will participate in the annual business meeting, election of reunion officers, a memorial service, and the ladies auxiliary auction on Thursday, June 16. That is also the evening of the Miss Cowpens Beauty Pageant.

<p>
On Friday morning, June 17th, the USS Cowpens crew will play a local little league team in the annual baseball game. Crew members and families are also invited to attend a morning brunch at the <a target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/?ll=35.04305,-81.796496">Bailey Home</a> and the great Adopt-a-Crew dinner that evening. Friday morning is also the day for the Mighty Moo Golf Tournament which provides a yearly scholarship to a graduating senior at our high school.   And, we are excited to have NASA joining us at this year's festivities with their DRIVEN TO EXPLORE mobile touring exhibit.  It will be located in the back parking lot of Central Baptist Church, just across the tracks from the Veterans Park and the Depot.  Friday it will be open to the public from 10:00am to 5:00pm, and open on Saturday from 10:00am to 4:00pm.

Saturday, June 18th, features the Moo parade, entertainment, arts & crafts, food, festivities and fun. The night ends with a huge street dance held at the Cowpens Veterans Park, from where you'll be able to see the spectacular fireworks display.

The reunion association also wraps up their yearly event with a closing banquet buffet at the Clarion on Saturday night.  It will be held in the First Floor Ballroom by the pool:

<p>
Anyone who is attending for the first time and is not familiar with all the many activities planned for the crew and their families is invited to contact me at cowtownjan@bellsouth.net. We are excitedly anticipating the attendance of several current crewmembers serving onboard the CG63 stationed in Japan. Our community extends wide opened arms and hearts to you all and hopes to have the chance to meet more of the outstanding, courageous, heroic men and women who have served onboard the two finest ships in the United States Navy. Be prepared to be spoiled rotten and leave our hometown knowing that you've found ties with family and friends which will last a lifetime.
